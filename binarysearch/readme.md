# What is binary search?

- Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the array into two halves that can contain the given target element, till the search area is limited to just one element. The necessary condition for binary search to work is the array needs to be sorted
- Total comparison in the worst case: logN

- find middle element
- if target is smaller than middle then ans will be on left side of middle
- if target is greater than middle then ans will be on right side of middle
- if target === middle find the ans
