recursion and backtracking is quite similar. 
In recursion we follow every possible path. And one of the path has solution.then we will tale solution from that path.
whereas in backtracking, We move to a path and check if this path will eventually lead to our solution or not.
If not we will backtrack else we will continue and check at every step.

Recursion will travel in every path.It is a brute force approch.
recursion will not check.Recursion is dumb.
backtracking is used for optimizing the solution.
