what is recursion?
when a function calls itself.
when a functions solves the smaller problem to solve a bigger problem

steps to develop recursive thinking :
DON'T THINK RECURSIVE
step 1: Write a iterative function to solve the problem
    -- ultimately not necessary but good for learning technique
    -- helps us get details right
    -- important that parameter list is correct

step 2: Write a "dispatcher" function
    dispatcher function will solve the problem for the minimal data set
    dispatcher call iterative function to handle not minimal data set
    dispatcher must handle the last case and call the iterative function for rest

step 3: replace iterative function call with the dispatcher and delete iterative function.

APPLYING THIS TECHNIQUE: start with problem you can solve iteratively.
